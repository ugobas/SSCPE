# SSCPE
This repository contains data used for calibrating and testing the Structure and stability constrained protein evolution substitution model computed by the program Prot_evol https://github.com/ugobas/Prot_evol

- Alignments.zip : Multiple sequence alignments including one PDB structure that gives name to the alignment. Courtesy of Julian Echave, Universidad Nacional de San Martin, Argentina. Input file to Prot_evol needed for computing the SSCPE models

- RMSD.zip : Predicted RMSD generated by all point mutations of the wild-type protein in the PDB. They are predicted by the program tnm https://github.com/ugobas/tnm with input parameter PRED_MUT=1. Input file to Prot_evol needed for computing the SSCPE models

- DE.zip  : Predicted harmonic energy barrier generated by all point mutations of the wild-type protein in the PDB. They are predicted by the program tnm https://github.com/ugobas/tnm with input parameter PRED_MUT=1. Input file to Prot_evol needed for computing the SSCPE models

- Rates.zip : Site-specific evolutionary rate, sequence entropy and hydrophobicity predicted by Prot_evol for every site of the tested proteins and number of contacts computed from the PDB structure

- Summary.zip : Properties of the different SSCPE models averaged over sites for all test proteins: Log-likelihood of the MSA, sequence entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergences, average hydrophobicity, and global folding free energy DeltaG

- Input_Prot_evol.in : Sample input file to the program Prot_evol

- Input_TNM.in : Sample input file to the program tnm

- Mutation_para.in : Mutation weights used by the tnm program for predicting the RMSD and DE. Input to the tnm program setting the line MUT_PARA=Mutation_para.in
